## Simple shopping list app

### Requirements:
- Display a list of shopping items with:
- An icon
- An aisle number
- Allow users to strike through an item once it has been added to the cart.
- Implement sorting:
- Alphabetically
- By aisle number
- If possible, make the sorting feel magical, like a Harry Potter spell (this is a fun bonus!).
- Keep it a single-page applicationâ€”just the shopping list.

- Time constraint: 2 hours

### Focus: 
- Clean code, separation of concerns
- Architecture, MVVM pattern, Unidirectional data flow
- Scalability (folder structure based on possible modules)
- Decent UI, simple but pleasant

### Tech stack:
- Room db with flows
- Koin for dependency injection
- Compose for UI
